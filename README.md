SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
**Key Features**

**Adaptive AI-Powered Interviews**:

  - AI dynamically adapts questions depending on answers.
  - Ice-breaking questions evolve into more in-depth technical and managerial questions.
  - Neural network personalizes interviews to expertise.
**Immersive VR Boardroom Simulation**:

  - VR boardroom increases interaction and minimizes stress.
  - AI-powered avatars offer real-time feedback on non-verbal behavior.
  - Gesture and facial analysis evaluate leadership and stress handling.
Automated Relevancy Scoring:

- **For Interviewers:** AI assesses relevance of questions and recommends enhancement.
  - **For Candidates:** AI scores answers on accuracy, clarity, and confidence.
  - Adaptive scoring normalizes for question difficulty and experience.
**Behavioral and Psychometric Analysis**:

  - AI assesses leadership, decision-making, and ethical judgment.
  - Sentiment analysis identifies hesitation, confidence, and emotional intelligence.
  - Gamified problem-solving evaluates critical thinking and innovation.
3. **Implementation Approach**:

- **Phase 1:** Construct AI-interview models and VR-boardroom.

- **Phase 2:** Pilot test with feedback to improve AI and scoring.
- **Phase 3:** Roll out with ongoing learning and optimization.
4. **Benefits**

-Unbiased & Objective: AI mitigates human bias.

-Continuous Learning:AI improves over time.
Holistic Evaluation:Technical, managerial, and behavioral insights.
Immersive Experience:Realistic VR minimizes stress.
Efficiency & Accuracy:** Speedier hiring through automated assessment.
